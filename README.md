Created a virtual post system evaluating website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Email Validation API that verifies the email addresses. The main outcome of our project is to streamline workflows, enhance user experience by providing real-time feedback by reducing errors. Here, we utilize an API that serves as the backend for our website. When a user submits a request to verify an email address, the email is directly sent to the backend. The API then processes the email and generates a result based on its attributes, determining whether the entered email is valid or not.
